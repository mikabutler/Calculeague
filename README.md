Calculator for League of Legends statistics

Project is not currently working, source to be updated shortly and will provide screenshots as I progress.

## What is it?
Much like the above states, I'm creating this to have a program that will be able to easily calculate League of Legends champion stats - the impact of their masteries, runes, and items, relative to their level and the like.

I plan to add further map and the ability to check on the servers and also perhaps pull summoner data (although this would conflict with current API permissions).

## How do I get it?
At this stage - by being patient, I'll develop it as fast as I can and I should be easily able to get the data. The biggest issue that will present itself is presentation.

I plan to have this deployable for web, and perhaps have it so that a mobile can use it. However, that being said, there will be some difficulties implicitly involved.

This project will be free for anyone to use and play with as they will, but as I haven't had time to investigate a license, don't expect too much just yet.
